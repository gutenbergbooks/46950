      I. A CHEERFUL WORKER
    </h2>
    <p class="indent20">
      A cheery whistle or a song
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Will help the daily work along.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he little
      feathered people of the Green Meadows, the Green Forest and the Old
      Orchard learned this long ago, and it is one reason why you will so often
      find them singing with all their might when they are hard at work building
      their homes in the spring. Most of them sing, but there is one who
      whistles, and it is such a clear and cheery whistle that it gladdens the
      hearts of all who hear it. Many and many a time has Farmer Brown's boy
      stopped to whistle back, and never has he failed to get a response.
    </p>
    <p>
      A handsome little fellow is this whistler. He is dressed in brown, white
      and black, and his name is Bob White. Sometimes he is called a Quail and
      sometimes a Partridge, but if you should ask him he would tell you
      promptly and clearly that he is Bob White, and he answers to no other
      name. All the other little people know and love him well, most of them for
      the cheery sound of his whistle; but a few, like Reddy Fox and Redtail the
      Hawk, for the good meal he will make them if only they are smart enough to
      catch him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Farmer Brown's boy loves him, not only for his cheerful whistle, but
      because he has found out that Bob White is a worker as well as a whistler,
      one of the best workers and greatest helpers on the farm. You see, a part
      of the work of Farmer Brown's boy is to keep down the weeds and destroy
      the insects that eat up the crops. Now weeds spring up from seeds. If
      there were no weed-seeds there would be no weeds. In the same way, if
      there were no insect-eggs there would be no insects. But there are
      millions and millions of both, and so all summer long Farmer Brown's boy
      has to fight the weeds and the insects. He is very thankful for any help
      he may get, and this is one reason he has become so fond of Old Mr. Toad,
      who helps him keep the garden clear of worms and bugs, and of Tommy Tit
      the Chickadee and others of the little feathered people who live in the
      Old Orchard and hunt bugs and their eggs among the apple-trees. You know
      the surest way of winning friends is to help others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bob White not only catches worms and bugs, but eats the seeds of weeds,
      scratching them out where they have hidden in the ground, and filling his
      little crop with them until he just has to fly to the nearest fence and
      tell all the world how happy he is to be alive and have a part in the work
      of the Great World. Not one of all the little people is of greater help to
      Farmer Brown's boy than Bob White. All the long day he works, and with him
      works Mrs. Bob and all the little Bobs, scratching up weed-seeds here,
      picking off bugs there, all the time so happy and cheerful that everybody
      in the neighborhood is happy and cheerful too. The best of it is Bob White
      is always just that way. You would think he never had a thing in the world
      to worry about. But he does have. Yes, indeed! Bob White has plenty to
      worry about, as you shall hear, but he never allows his troubles to
      interfere with his cheerfulness if he can help it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Bob White! Bob White!&rdquo; with all his might
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      He whistles loud and clear.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Because no shame e'er hurt his name
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He wants that all shall hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      One day Peter Rabbit sat listening to it, and it reminded him that he
      hadn't called on Bob White for some time, and also that there were some
      things about Bob White that he didn't know. He decided that he would go at
      once to call on Bob and try to satisfy his curiosity. So off he started,
      lipperty-lipperty-lip.

      II. BOB WHITE HAS VISITORS
    </h2>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Bob White! Bob White! I bid the world good
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      cheer!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Bob White! Bob White! I whistle loud and clear!&rdquo;

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HAT very same
      morning Bob White had taken it into his head to come over to live not very
      far from the dear Old Briar-patch where Peter Rabbit lives. Of course,
      Peter didn't know that Bob had come over there to live. For that matter, I
      doubt if Bob White knew it himself. He just happened over that way and
      liked it, and so finally he made up his mind to look about there for a
      place to make his home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Peter Rabbit had known Bob White for a long time. Peter, in his
      roaming about, had met Bob a number of times, and they had passed the time
      of day. Whenever Peter had heard Bob whistling within a reasonable
      distance he had made it a point to call on him. Bob is such a cheery
      fellow that somehow Peter always felt better for just a word or two with
      him. So when Bob began to whistle that spring morning Peter hurried over,
      lipperty-lipperty-lip, to call. He didn't have far to go, for Bob was
      sitting on a fence-post just a little way from the dear Old Briar-patch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;You seem to be very cheerful this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; replied Bob White. &ldquo;I'm always cheerful. It's the only way to
      get along in this world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be that you don't have much to worry about,&rdquo; retorted Peter. &ldquo;Now
      if you had to run for your life as often as I have to, perhaps you
      wouldn't find it so easy to be always cheerful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bob White's bright little eyes twinkled. &ldquo;The trouble with a lot of people
      is that they think that no one has worries but themselves,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Now
      there is Reddy Fox coming this way. What do you suppose he is coming for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For me!&rdquo; exclaimed Peter promptly, preparing to scamper back to the Old
      Briar-patch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing of the kind,&rdquo; replied Bob White. &ldquo;Don't think you are so
      important, Peter. He doesn't know you are over here at all. He has heard
      me whistling, and he's coming to see if he can't give me a little
      surprise. It's me and not you he is after. What's your hurry, Peter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I think I'd better be going; I'll call again when you haven't
      other visitors,&rdquo; shouted Peter over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had Peter reached the dear Old Briar-patch when Reddy Fox reached
      the fence where Bob White was sitting. &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; said he, trying to
      make his voice sound as pleasant as he could, &ldquo;I'm glad to see you over
      here. I heard you whistling and hurried over here to welcome you. I hope
      you will like here so well that you will make your home here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very nice of you,&rdquo; replied Bob White, his eyes twinkling more
      than ever, for he knew why Reddy hoped he would make his home there. He
      knew that Reddy hoped to find that home and make a good dinner on Quail
      some day. &ldquo;It is very pleasant over here, and I don't know but I will
      stay. Everybody seems very neighborly. Peter Rabbit has just called.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reddy looked about him in a very sly way but with a hungry look in his
      eyes as he said, &ldquo;Peter always is neighborly. Is he anywhere about now? I
      should like to pay my respects to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Bob White. &ldquo;Peter left in something of a hurry. Hello! Here
      comes Old Man Coyote. People certainly are neighborly here. Why, what's
      your hurry, Reddy?&rdquo;

       replied Reddy, with a hasty glance in the direction of Old Man Coyote. &ldquo;I
      hope I'll see you often, Bob White.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; replied Bob White politely, and then added under his breath,
      &ldquo;but I hope I see you first.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      III. BOB DECIDES TO BUILD A HOME
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>LD Man Coyote's
      call was very much like that of Reddy Fox. He was very, very pleasant and
      told Bob White that he was very glad indeed that Bob had come over on the
      Green Meadows, and he hoped that he would stay. No one could have been
      more polite than was Old Man Coyote. Bob White was just as polite, but he
      wasn't fooled. No, indeed. He knew that, just like Reddy Fox, the reason
      Old Man Coyote was so glad to see him was because he hoped to catch him
      some fine day. But Bob White didn't let a little thing like that bother
      him. Ever since he could remember he had been hunted. That was why he had
      taken the precaution to sit on a fence-post when he whistled. Up there
      neither Old Man Coyote nor Reddy Fox could reach him. Just after Old Man
      Coyote left Bob White saw some one else headed his way, and this time he
      didn't wait. You see it was Redtail the Hawk, and a fence-post was no
      place to receive a call from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spreading his wings Bob White flew across to the dear Old Briar-patch and
      dropped in among the brambles close to where Peter Rabbit was sitting.
      &ldquo;You didn't expect me to return your call so soon, did you, Peter?&rdquo; said
      he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Peter, &ldquo;but I'm ever so glad to see you just the same. Did
      you have a pleasant call from Reddy Fox?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very,&rdquo; replied Bob White with a chuckle. &ldquo;He was ever so glad to see me.
      So was Old Man Coyote. I didn't wait to see what Old Redtail would say,
      but I have a feeling that he would have liked better to have seen me a
      little nearer. You see, Peter, you are not the only one who has to keep
      his eyes open and his wits about him all the time. There are just as many
      looking for me as for you, but I don't allow that to make me any the less
      cheerful. Every time I whistle 1 know that some one is going to come
      looking for me, but I whistle just the same. I just have to, because in
      spite of all its troubles life is worth living and full of happiness. Now
      I've got a secret to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Peter eagerly. &ldquo;Promise not to tell a single soul,&rdquo;
       commanded Bob White.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't I tell Mrs. Peter? I never keep secrets from her you know,&rdquo; replied
      Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you may tell her, but she must promise to keep it secret,&rdquo; said
      Bob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll promise for her and for myself,&rdquo; declared Peter. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've decided to come over here to live,&rdquo; replied Bob White.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right here in the Old Briar-patch?&rdquo; asked Peter excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but not far from here,&rdquo; replied Bob White. &ldquo;I'm going back to the Old
      Pasture after Mrs. Bob, and we are going to build a home right away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goody!&rdquo; cried Peter, clapping his hands. &ldquo;Where are you going to build?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; replied Bob White, &ldquo;is for Mrs. Bob to decide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when she does you'll tell me where it is so that I can come over and
      call, won't you?&rdquo; cried Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends,&rdquo; replied Bob White. &ldquo;You know there are some things it is
      better not to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't know,&rdquo; retorted Peter. &ldquo;I'm your friend, and I don't see what
      harm it could do for me to know where your home is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without meaning to friends sometimes do the most harm of any one,
      especially if they talk too much,&rdquo; replied Bob White. &ldquo;Now the way is
      clear and I must hurry back to the Old Pasture to tell Mrs. Bob how nice
      it is here.&rdquo; And with this away he flew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now what did he mean by friends who talk too much,&rdquo; muttered Peter.
      &ldquo;Could he have meant me?&rdquo;
     </p>

      IV. BOB WHITE AND PETER BECOME NEIGHBORS
    </h2>

      Who strictly minds his own affairs

    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Always to be my neighbor.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HAT is just the
      kind of a neighbor Peter Rabbit found Bob White to be. Bob and Mrs. Bob
      had come down from the Old Pasture and built their home near the dear Old
      Briar-patch and so become the neighbors of Peter and little Mrs. Peter.
      Bob was very neighborly. He often dropped in to have a chat with Peter,
      and Peter was always glad to see him, for he is such a cheerful fellow
      that Peter always felt better for having him about. It always is that way
      with cheerful people. They are just like sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though Bob and Mrs. Bob had built their home near Peter, he didn't
      know just where it was. No, Sir, Peter didn't know just where that home of
      the Bob Whites was. It wasn't because he didn't try to find out. Oh, my,
      no! Peter could no more have helped trying to find out than he could have
      helped breathing. That was the curiosity in him. He wasted a great deal of
      time trying to find Bob White's home, all to no purpose. At first he was
      rather put out because Bob White wouldn't tell him where it was hidden.
      But Bob just smiled and told Peter that the reason he wouldn't was because
      he thought a great deal of Peter and wanted him for a friend always.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;I should think you would tell me where your home is.
      There ought not to be secrets between friends. I don't think much of a
      friendship that cannot be trusted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How would you feel, Peter, if harm came to me and my family through you?&rdquo;
       asked Bob White.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dreadfully,&rdquo; declared Peter. &ldquo;But do you suppose I would let any harm
      come to you? A nice kind of a friend you must think me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Bob White soberly, &ldquo;I don't think you would let any harm
      come to us if you knew it. But you've lived long enough, Peter, to know
      that there are eyes and ears and noses watching, listening, smelling
      everywhere all the time. Now supposing that when you were sure that nobody
      saw you, somebody <i>did</i> see you visit my house. Or supposing Reddy
      Fox just happened to run across your tracks and followed them to my house.
      It wouldn't be your fault if something dreadful happened to us, yet you
      would be the cause of it. You remember what I told you the other day, that
      there are some things it is better not to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter looked very thoughtful and pulled his whiskers while he turned this
      over in his mind. &ldquo;That is a new idea to me,&rdquo; said he at last. &ldquo;I never
      had thought of it before. I certainly never would be able to forgive
      myself if anything happened to you because of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you wouldn't,&rdquo; replied Bob White. &ldquo;No more would I ever be able
      to forgive myself if anything happened to my family because I had told
      some one where my home is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter nodded. &ldquo;Of course if I should just happen to <i>find</i> your home
      all by myself, you wouldn't be angry, would you?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bob White laughed. &ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Just the same I would advise
      you not to <i>try</i> to find it. Then you will have nothing to trouble
      your mind if you should be followed, and something dreadful did happen to
      me or mine. You see there are just as many who would like to make a dinner
      of me as there are who would like to make a dinner of you, and I would a
      whole lot rather sit on a fence-post and whistle than to fill somebody's
      stomach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I would a lot rather have you,&rdquo; declared Peter.

      V. OTHERS ARE INTERESTED IN BOB WHITE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>ETER RABBIT wasn't
      the only one who was interested in Bob White and in Bob's hidden home. Oh,
      my, no! It seemed to Peter that Reddy and Granny Fox were prowling around
      the dear Old Briar-patch most of the time. At first he didn't understand
      it. &ldquo;It isn't me they are after, because they know well enough that they
      can't catch me here,&rdquo; said he to himself, as he watched them one morning.
      &ldquo;It isn't Danny Meadow Mouse, because Danny hasn't been over this way for
      a long time. I don't see how it can be Bob White, because he isn't likely
      to stay on the ground while they are around, and they can't catch him
      unless he is on the ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was so busy trying to puzzle out what should bring Reddy and Granny
      that way so often that he neither saw nor heard Jimmy Skunk steal up
      behind him.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Boo!&rdquo; said Jimmy, and Peter nearly jumped out of his skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you do that for?&rdquo; demanded Peter indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just to teach you that you shouldn't go to sleep without keeping your
      ears open,&rdquo; replied Jimmy with a grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn't asleep!&rdquo; protested Peter crossly. &ldquo;I was just watching Reddy and
      Granny Fox and wondering what brings them over here so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might just as well have been asleep,&rdquo; replied Jimmy. &ldquo;Supposing I had
      been my cousin, Shadow the Weasel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter shivered at the very thought. Jimmy continued: &ldquo;You are old enough
      to know, Peter, that it isn't safe to be so interested in one thing that
      you forget to watch out for other things. As for Reddy and Granny Fox, you
      ought to know what brings them over this way so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; demanded Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hasn't Bob White got a nest somewhere around here?&rdquo; asked Jimmy by way of
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Y-e-s,&rdquo; replied Peter slowly, &ldquo;I suppose he has. But what of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Reddy and Granny are looking for it, stupid,&rdquo; replied Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter stared at Jimmy a minute in a puzzled way. &ldquo;What do they want of
      that?&rdquo; he asked finally. &ldquo;They don't eat eggs, do they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eggs hatch out into little birds, don't they?&rdquo; demanded Jimmy. &ldquo;If Reddy
      and Granny can find that nest, they'll wait until the eggs have hatched
      into birds and then, well, I've heard say that there is nothing more
      delicious than young Quail. Now, do you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter did. Of course he did. He understood perfectly. Reddy and Granny had
      heard Bob White whistling over there every day, and they knew that meant
      that his home wasn't far away. It was all very plain now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, you don't happen to know where that nest is, do you?&rdquo; asked
      Jimmy carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't!&rdquo; exclaimed Peter, and suddenly was glad that he didn't know
      about that nest. &ldquo;What do you want to know for?&rdquo; he demanded suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm hungry for some eggs,&rdquo; confessed Jimmy frankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn't rob Mr. and Mrs. Bob White of their eggs, would you?&rdquo; cried
      Peter. &ldquo;I thought better of you than that, Jimmy Skunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy grinned. &ldquo;Don't get excited, Peter,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I'm told that Mrs.
      Bob lays a great many eggs, and if that's the case, she wouldn't miss a
      few.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmy Skunk, you're horrid, so there!&rdquo; declared Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't blame me,&rdquo; retorted Jimmy. &ldquo;Old Mother Nature gave me a taste for
      eggs, just as she gave Reddy Fox a taste for Rabbit. You haven't any idea
      where that nest is, have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I haven't! If I had, I wouldn't tell you,&rdquo; declared Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, so long,&rdquo; replied Jimmy good-naturedly. &ldquo;I think I'll have a look
      for it. I don't wish Bob White and his wife the least bit of harm, but I
      would like two or three of those eggs.&rdquo; And with this Jimmy Skunk ambled
      out to look for Bob White's nest.

    <h2>
      VI. THE CUNNING OF MR. AND MRS. BOB WHITE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN Bob White
      brought Mrs. Bob down to the Green Meadows from the Old Pasture in the
      beautiful springtime, she was as delighted as he had hoped she would be.
      Very wisely he had not even hinted that he thought there was the place of
      all places for them to build their home. He knew that she would never be
      satisfied unless she felt that she was the one who had chosen the place
      for their home. So Bob didn't so much as hint that he had a home in mind.
      He didn't even tell her how beautiful it was over on the Green Meadows
      near the dear Old Briar-patch. He let her find it out for herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now little Mrs. Bob was very anxious to get to housekeeping, and no sooner
      did she reach the Green Meadows than she made up her mind that here was
      the place of all places for a home. In the first place it was very
      beautiful, and Mrs. Bob has an eye for beauty. In the second place there
      was plenty to eat, one of the most important things to consider when you
      are likely to have a great many little mouths to feed. In the third place
      there were plenty of good hiding places, and lastly, Mrs. Bob liked the
      neighbors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bob White took care not to let her see that he was tickled. He gravely
      pointed out to her the fact that Granny and Reddy Fox, Old Man Coyote and
      Red-tail the Hawk would soon discover that they were living there, and
      then there would be danger all the time and they would never know what it
      was to be free from worry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit more than in the Old Pasture where we built last year,&rdquo; snapped
      Mrs. Bob. &ldquo;You know as well as I do that wherever we build we will be in
      danger. It always has been so, and I guess it always will be so. We've
      been smart enough to fool our enemies before, and I guess we can do it
      again. I'm not afraid if you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bob hastened to say that he wasn't afraid. He wouldn't have her think that
      for the world. Oh, my, no! He was just pointing out the dangers so that
      they might make no mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bob didn't half hear what he was saying. She was too busy poking
      about, running here, running there, and all the time using her sharp
      little eyes for all they were worth. Bob waited patiently, a twinkle in
      his own eyes. He knew that when Mrs. Bob made up her mind that was all
      there was to it. Presently she called to him in a low voice, and he flew
      over to join her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; she announced, &ldquo;is where we will build.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bob looked the ground over with a critical eye. &ldquo;Don't you think, my dear,
      that this is rather close to the Crooked Little Path?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I have
      noticed that Reddy Fox and Timmy Skunk use this path a great deal, not to
      mention Farmer Brown's boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what makes it the safest place on the Green Meadows, stupid,&rdquo;
       declared little Mrs. Bob. &ldquo;They will never think to look for our home so
      close to where they pass. These weeds are very thick and will hide our
      nest completely. This old fallen fence-post will give splendid protection
      on one side. The Old Briar-patch is so near that in case of need we can
      get to it in a hurry and there be perfectly safe. You mark my words, Bob
      White, no one will think of looking here for our nest if you use your
      common sense and do all your whistling far enough away. Reddy and the
      others are going to do all their hunting around the place you do your
      whistling, so it is for you to make this the very safest place in the
      world. Do you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear,&rdquo; replied Bob meekly. &ldquo;You are very clever and cunning. I
      never should have thought of choosing such a place, but I guess you are
      quite right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know I am,&rdquo; retorted Mrs. Bob. &ldquo;Now you fly over to the other side of
      the Old Briar-patch and whistle while I get busy here. I am anxious to get
      to work at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bob looked at his little brown wife with admiration. Then he discreetly
      ran under cover of the weeds and grass until he thought it was safe to
      take wing, after which he flew to the other side of the dear Old
      Briar-patch and there began to whistle as only he can.

    <h2>
      VII. BOB WHITE FINDS THAT MRS. BOB IS RIGHT
    </h2>
    <p class="indent20">
      A quarrel you may often stay
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      By letting others have their way.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>ND you will find,
      too, that other people are quite as likely to be right as you are. Now
      while Bob White told Mrs. Bob that he guessed she was right in choosing
      the place she did for their home he was not at all sure of it in his own
      mind. It wasn't a place he would have chosen if the matter had been left
      to him. No, Sir, that place wouldn't have been his choice. He knew of at
      least half a dozen places which he thought much better and safer. But,
      after all, this was to be Mrs. Bob's home even more than his, for she was
      the one who would have to stay there all the long days sitting on those
      beautiful white eggs they hoped to have soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Bob kept his opinions to himself, and if he worried a little because
      the new home was so close to the Crooked Little Path along which Reddy and
      Granny Fox went so often, he said nothing and brought his share of
      grasses, straw and leaves with which to build the nest. Mrs. Bob was very
      particular about that nest. Just a common open nest wouldn't do. Perhaps
      in that wise little head of hers she guessed just what was going on in
      Bob's mind and how he really didn't approve at all of building there. So
      she made a very clever little roof or dome of grasses and straw over the
      nest with a little entrance on one side. When it was all done only the
      very sharpest eyes ever would discover it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course Bob was proud of it, very proud indeed. &ldquo;My dear, it's the
      finest nest I've ever seen,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I hope, I do hope no one will
      find it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bob looked at him sharply. &ldquo;Why don't you own up that you wish it was
      somewhere else?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bob looked a little foolish. &ldquo;I can't quite get over the idea that this is
      a very dangerous place,&rdquo; he confessed. &ldquo;But I've great faith in your
      judgment, my dear,&rdquo; he hastened to add.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then see to it that you are careful when you come over this way and never
      under any circumstances fly directly here,&rdquo; retorted Mrs. Bob. &ldquo;Keep away
      unless I call for you, and when you do come fly over in the long grass
      back there and then keep out of sight and walk over here under cover of
      the grass and weeds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bob promised he would do just as she had told him to, and to prove it he
      stole away through the long grass and did not take wing until he was far
      from the nest. Then he flew over beyond the dear Old Briar-path and
      whistled with all his might from sheer happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It wasn't long before there were fifteen beautiful white eggs in the nest
      in the weeds beside the Crooked Little Path, and then Bob's anxiety
      increased, you may be sure. Time and time again he saw Reddy Fox or Granny
      Fox or Jimmy Skunk trot down the Crooked Little Path and he knew that they
      were coming to look for his nest. But never once did they think of looking
      in that patch of weeds, for it never entered their heads that any one
      would build so close to a path they used so much. But they hunted and
      hunted everywhere else.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all the time little Mrs. Bob sat on those white eggs and the color of
      her cloak was so nearly the color of the brown grasses and leaves that
      even if they had looked straight at her it isn't at all likely that they
      would have seen her. Little by little Bob confessed to himself that Mrs.
      Bob was right. She had chosen the very safest place on the Green Meadows
      for their home. It was safest because it was the last place any one would
      look for it. Then Bob grew less anxious and spent all his spare time in
      fooling those who were looking for his home.

      them. But Bob White didn't feel that there was anything unfair in trying
      to fool his neighbors. Not a bit of it. You see, he was doing it for love
      and war both. He was doing it for love of shy little Mrs. Bob and their
      home, and for the kind of war that is always going on in the Green Forest
      and the Green Meadows. Of course, the little people who live there don't
      call it war, but you know how it is&mdash;the big people all the time
      trying to catch those smaller than themselves, and the little people all
      the time trying to get the best of the big people.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Bob White felt that it was perfectly fair and right that he should fool
      those of his neighbors who were hunting for his home, and so it was. He
      would sit on a fence-post whistling as only he can whistle, and telling
      all the world that he, Bob White, was there. Presently he would see Reddy
      Fox trotting down the Crooked Little Path and pretending that he was just
      out for a stroll and not at all interested in Bob or his affairs. Then Bob
      would pretend to look all around as if to see that no danger was near.
      After that he would fly over to a certain place which looked to be just
      the kind of a place for a nest, and there he would hide in the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as soon as he disappeared, Reddy Fox would grin in that sly way of
      his and say to himself, &ldquo;So that's where your nest is! I think I'll have a
      look over there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he would steal over to where he had seen Bob disappear and poke his
      sharp nose into every bunch of grass and peek under every little bush. Bob
      would wait until he heard those soft footsteps very near him, then he
      would fly up with a great noise of his swift little wings as if he were
      terribly frightened, and from a distant fence-post he would call in the
      most anxious sounding voice. Reddy would be sure then that he was near the
      nest and would hunt and hunt. All the time little Mrs. Bob would be
      sitting comfortably on those precious eggs in the nest in the weed-patch
      close beside the Crooked Little Path, chuckling to herself as she listened
      to Bob's voice. You see, she knew just what he was doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the same way with Jimmy Skunk and Granny Fox and even Peter Rabbit.
      All of them hunted and hunted for that nest and watched Bob White and were
      sure that they knew just where to look for his home, and afterward
      wondered why it was that they couldn't find it. Jimmy Skunk wanted some of
      those eggs. Reddy and Granny Fox wanted to catch Mrs. Bob or be ready to
      gobble up the babies when they should hatch out of those beautiful white
      eggs. As for Peter Rabbit, he wanted to know where that nest was just out
      of curiosity. He wouldn't have harmed Mrs. Bob or one of those eggs for
      the world. But Bob knew that if Peter knew where that nest was he might
      visit it when some one was watching him, and something dreadful might
      happen as a result. So he thought it best to fool Peter just as he did the
      others, and I think it was. Don't you?

      IX. PETER HAS HARD WORK BELIEVING HIS OWN EYES
    </h2>
    <p class="indent20">
      When with your eyes you see a thing
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      Yet can't believe it so,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Pray tell me what you can believe.
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      I'd really like to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HINGS are that way
      sometimes. They are so surprising that it doesn't seem that they can be
      true. Just ask Peter Rabbit, or little Mrs. Peter. Either one will tell
      you that they have had hard work to believe what their eyes saw. You see,
      it was this way: Peter knew that somewhere near the dear Old Briar-patch
      was the home of Bob White. Anyway Bob had said that it was near there, and
      he himself was never very far away. So Peter didn't doubt that Bob had
      told him the truth. No one would stay around one place day after day in
      the beautiful springtime, when everybody was busy housekeeping, unless his
      home was very near.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Peter had looked and looked for that home of Bob White's without ever
      getting so much as a glimpse of it. He had watched Bob White and had
      visited every place that he saw Bob go to, but Bob had managed to keep his
      secret and Peter was no wiser than before, though he was thinner from
      running about so much. Little Mrs. Peter had tried her best to make him
      see that it was no business of his. You see, she knew just how Mrs. Bob
      felt about wanting her home a secret, for little Mrs. Peter had had many
      anxious hours when her own babies were very small.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally Peter did give up, but it was because he had looked in every place
      he could think of and at last had made up his mind that if Bob White
      really had a nest in the Green Meadows it certainly wasn't near the dear
      Old Briar-patch. Then one morning a surprising thing happened. Peter was
      just getting ready to run over to the Laughing Brook when some one right
      in front of him there in the Old Briar-patch exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0006" id="linkimage-0006"> </a>

    <p>
      &ldquo;Be careful where you step, Peter Rabbit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter stopped short and looked to see who had spoken. There, under a
      tangle of brambles, was little Mrs. Bob White. Peter was surprised, for he
      had not seen her enter the dear Old Briar-patch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said he. Then he bowed politely. &ldquo;How do you do, Mrs. Bob White? I'm
      glad you've decided to make us a call. I hope Bob is very well. I haven't
      seen him for several days, but I've heard his whistle and it sounds as if
      he were feeling very fine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is,&rdquo; replied little Mrs. Bob. Then she added anxiously, &ldquo;Do please be
      very careful where you step, Peter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? What's the matter?&rdquo; asked Peter, looking down at his feet in a
      puzzled way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then Mrs. Peter, who had heard them talking, came hurrying up. Mrs.
      Bob White became more anxious than ever. &ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Peter, do, do be
      careful where <i>you</i> step!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Peter looked as puzzled as Peter did. Just then little Mrs. Bob
      uttered the softest, sweetest little call, and all at once it seemed to
      Peter and Mrs. Peter as if the brown leaves which carpeted the dear Old
      Briar-patch suddenly came to life and started to run. Peter's eyes almost
      popped out of his head, and he rubbed them twice to make sure that he
      really saw what he thought he saw. What was it? Why, a whole family of the
      funniest little birds scurrying as fast as their small legs could take
      them to the shelter of Mrs. Bob's wings!

      darlings? I'm so glad you brought them over for us to see, Mrs. Bob. How
      many are there?&rdquo; cried little Mrs. Peter, as she and Peter watched the
      tiny little babies of Bob White scamper to the shelter of their mother's
      wings under the friendly brambles of the dear Old Briar-patch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are fifteen,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Bob White proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My gracious, what a family!&rdquo; exclaimed Peter. &ldquo;I don't see how you keep
      track of all of them. I should think you would be worried to death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are a great care,&rdquo; confessed little Mrs. Bob White. &ldquo;That is why I
      have brought them over to the Old Briar-patch. I hope you and Mrs. Peter
      will not mind if we live here for a while. Until they can fly it is the
      safest place I know of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll be tickled to death to have you here,&rdquo; declared Peter. &ldquo;We don't
      own the dear Old Briar-patch, though we've lived here so long we almost
      feel as if it belongs to us. But of course any one who wants to is free to
      live here. I don't know of any one we would rather have here than you and
      your family. By the way, I don't see how you could travel far with such
      little babies. May I ask where you came from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Little Mrs. Bob's eyes twinkled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;We haven't traveled far. We came straight from
      our home here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where was your home?&rdquo; Peter asked the question eagerly, for you
      remember he had spent a great deal of time trying to find that home of the
      Bob Whites.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just over yonder in that little patch of weeds across the Crooked Little
      Path. You see it was very handy to the Old Briar-patch,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Bob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; Peter fairly shouted. &ldquo;Do you mean to say that you have been
      living so near as all that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bob nodded. &ldquo;I surely have,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I've been right where I
      could see you every day as I sat on my eggs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how did you dare build in such a dangerous place? Why, Reddy and
      Granny Fox passed within a few feet of you every day! I never heard of
      such a crazy thing!&rdquo; Peter looked as if he didn't believe it even yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the safest place on the Green Meadows,&rdquo; retorted Mrs. Bob. &ldquo;I
      should think that by this time you would have learned, Peter Rabbit, that
      the safest place to hide is the place where no one will look. The proof of
      it is right here in these babies of mine. Aren't they darlings? I sat
      there day after day and watched you and Reddy and Granny Fox and Jimmy
      Skunk hunting for me and had many a good laugh all to myself. I knew that
      not one of you would dream that I would be so foolishly wise as to build
      my home where it could be so easily found, and therefore you wouldn't look
      for it there. And I was right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Peter chuckled. &ldquo;You were just right, Mrs. Bob,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;It is
      the smartest thing I ever heard of, my dear. If Peter doesn't feel
      foolish, he ought to. I told him that it was none of his business where
      your home was, but he was so curious that he would keep hunting for it.
      And to think that all the time it was close by! Don't you feel foolish,
      Peter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear, I certainly do,&rdquo; replied Peter meekly. &ldquo;But now that I know
      where it was I am satisfied. And I'm glad that Mrs. Bob has brought her
      family to live in the dear Old Briar-patch. I think it will be great fun
      watching those youngsters grow, and I can't help thinking that this is a
      great deal safer for them than the home they have just left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's why I've brought them here,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Bob. &ldquo;As long as they
      were only eggs that was the safest place, but now that they have hatched
      out and can run about, they wouldn't be safe a minute over there. As it
      is, I expect it won't be long before they will be wanting to get out in
      the Great World and then my worries will really begin. Bringing up a large
      family is a great responsibility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Peter.

      XI. WATCH TOUR STEP!
    </h2>
    <p class="indent20">
      Watch your step! Be sure you know
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      Exactly what lies just before,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Because if you should careless be
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      'Tis certain you would step no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T wasn't that way
      with Peter Rabbit. He wasn't afraid that if he didn't watch out he would
      step no more, not in the Old Briar-patch anyway, but he was afraid,
      dreadfully afraid, that one of Bob White's babies might step no more. It
      seemed to Peter that they were always just under foot. It made him
      nervous. Every time he moved little Mrs. Bob or Mrs. Peter was sure to
      cry, &ldquo;Watch your step, Peter!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Don't step on one of those darlings!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So every time he moved Peter looked sharply to see that there wasn't a
      tiny brown bird hiding under a brown leaf. You know he wouldn't have
      stepped on one of them for the world. Really there wasn't half as much
      danger as their fond mother seemed to think, for little as they were those
      Bob White babies were very spry, and very smart too. But you know how it
      is with mothers; they seem to be always expecting something dreadful will
      happen to their babies.
    </p>
    <p>
      So twenty times a day Peter would hear that warning, &ldquo;Watch your step!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still, in spite of this, he was glad that the Bob White family had moved
      over to the dear Old Briar-patch. It gave him a chance to learn more about
      the ways of Bob White and his children than he could possibly have learned
      in any other way. You know, Peter is always anxious to learn, especially
      about other people. It seemed to him that never had he seen babies grow as
      did the little Bob Whites. They were everywhere. There were fifteen of
      them, and Peter often wondered how under the sun their mother kept track
      of all of them. But she did. One thing he noticed, and this was that they
      obeyed promptly whenever she called to them. If Redtail the Hawk came
      sailing lazily over the old Briar-patch, watching with sharp eyes to see
      if anything was going on down there that he didn't know about, little Mrs.
      Bob would give a warning, and every one of those youngsters would squat
      down right where he happened to be and not move until she told him he
      might. So old Red-tail never once suspected that the Bob White family was
      there. When Mrs. Bob called them to her, they came running on the instant.
      Such obedience was beautiful to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, when they were all nestled under her wings, she would tell them
      about the Great World and all the dangers that they would have to watch
      out for when they were big enough to go out into it, and how each one was
      to be met. As they ran this way and that way in the Old Briar-patch, they
      picked up tiny seeds. Peter had not supposed that there were so many seeds
      as those little Bob Whites found. You know Peter does not eat tiny seeds,
      and so he never had noticed them before. Mrs. Bob led them about, showing
      them what seeds were best and what to leave alone. They didn't have to be
      shown but once. Often they varied their fare by picking tiny insects from
      the low-hanging leaves, and once in a while there would be a struggle
      between two or more for possession of a worm. Peter always liked to watch
      this. It was very funny.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few days there were no bugs or worms to be found in the Old
      Briar-patch, at least not on or near the ground. The Bob White family had
      eaten <i>every one.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish they would live here all the time,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Peter. &ldquo;I don't
      like bugs and worms. They give me a crawly feeling every time I see them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But a growing family must have plenty to eat, and at the end of a week
      Mrs. Bob led her youngsters forth to hunt bugs and worms and seeds on the
      Green Meadows, but never very far from the Old Briar-patch, so that in
      case of need they could run back to its friendly shelter. And every night
      she brought them back there to sleep under the friendly brambles. So after
      all, it was only for a little while that Peter had to watch his steps, and
      he was really sorry when he no longer heard that warning every time he
      moved. You see, he had grown very fond of the little Bob Whites.

      XII. THE LITTLE BOB WHITES AT SCHOOL
    </h2>
    <p class="indent30">
      Everybody goes to school;
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      That's the universal rule.
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      Mother Nature long ago
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      Said it always should be so.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>F course there are
      all kinds of schools, but to one kind or another everybody has to go. A
      lot of people don't know they are going to school, but they are, just the
      same. If you should ask them what school they go to, they would tell you
      they don't go to any. But they do just the same. They go to the hardest
      school of all, the school of experience. That is the school in which we
      all learn how to live and take care of ourselves. It is just the same with
      the little meadow and forest people. The four babies of Johnny and Polly
      Chuck went to school in the Old Orchard just as soon as they were big
      enough to run around. It was the same way with the children of Peter
      Rabbit in the dear Old Briar-patch and the youngsters of Danny and Nanny
      Meadow Mouse on the Green Meadows and Une' Billy Possum's lively family in
      the Green Forest and little Joe Otter's two hopefuls in the Laughing
      Brook. So of course all the Little Bob Whites started in to go to school
      almost as soon as they were out of their shells.
    </p>
    <p>
      The very first thing they learned was to mind their parents, which is the
      very first lesson all little folks must learn. &ldquo;You see, my dears,&rdquo;
       explained Mrs. Bob, as they nestled under her wings, &ldquo;the Great World is
      full of dangers, especially for little Bob Whites, and so if you want to
      live to grow up to be as handsome and smart as your father, you must mind
      instantly when we speak to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So as every one of the fifteen little Bob Whites wanted to five to grow up
      to be as handsome and smart as their father, each one took the greatest
      care to mind the very second Bob or Mrs. Bob spoke. While they were in the
      dear Old Briar-patch they were quite safe, but just the same every little
      while Mrs. Bob would give the danger signal, which meant to squat and keep
      perfectly still, or another call that meant to come running to her as fast
      as ever they could. It wasn't until she was sure that they had learned to
      mind instantly that she led them out on to the Green Meadows among the
      grasses and the weeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was always real danger as she took great pains to tell them.
      There was danger from the air where old Redtail the Hawk sailed round and
      round, watching below for heedless and careless little folks. There was
      danger from Reddy and Granny Fox and Old Man Coyote, prowling about with
      sharp eyes and keen ears and wonderful noses, all the time hunting for
      heedless little people. And there was danger from Mr. Blacksnake and some
      of his cousins, slipping silently through the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the little Bob Whites learned to be always on the watch as they ran
      this way and that way, hunting for bugs and worms and seeds. At the least
      little unknown sound they squatted and waited for Mrs. Bob's signal that
      all was well. She taught them to know Ol' Mistah Buzzard, who wouldn't
      hurt a feather of them, from old Redtail the Hawk by the way he sailed and
      sailed without flapping his wings. Just as soon as they could fly a
      little, she taught them to make sure just where the nearest bushes or
      trees were so that they could fly to them in case of sudden danger on the
      ground. She taught them how to find the safest places in which to spend
      the night. Oh, there was a great deal for those little Bob Whites to
      learn! Yes, indeed. And it didn't do to forget a single thing. Forgetting
      just once might mean a dreadful thing. So they didn't forget. Bob White
      himself taught them many things, for Bob is wise in the ways of the Great
      World, and he is the best of fathers. So the little Bob Whites grew and
      grew until they were too big to nestle under the wings of Mrs. Bob and
      could fly on swift strong wings. And all the time they were at school
      without knowing it.

      XIII. FARMER BROWN'S BOY BECOMES THOUGHTFUL

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>ON,&rdquo; said Fanner
      Brown one morning at the breakfast table, &ldquo;we've got the finest looking
      garden any where around. I don't remember ever having a garden with so
      little harm done by bugs and worms. All our neighbors are complaining that
      bugs and worms are the worst ever this year, and that their gardens are
      being eaten up in spite of all that they can do. I'm proud of the way in
      which you've taken care of ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Farmer Brown's boy flushed with pleasure. He had worked hard in that
      garden ever since the seeds were planted.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had fought the weeds and the bugs and worms. But so had some of his
      neighbors. Yet in spite of this their gardens were nearly ruined. They had
      worked just as hard as he had, but the worms and the bugs had been too
      much for them. He couldn't understand why he had succeeded when they had
      failed. There must be a reason. There is a reason for everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast he put on his old straw hat and started down to the garden
      to look it over, still puzzling over the reason why his garden was so much
      better than others. Just on the edge of the garden was an old board. He
      lifted one end of it and peeped under. Old Mr. Toad looked up at him and
      blinked sleepily, but in the most friendly way. Mr. Toad's waistcoat was
      filled out until it looked too tight for comfort. Fanner Brown's boy
      smiled as he put the board down gently. He knew what made that waistcoat
      so tight; it was filled with bugs and worms. &ldquo;There's a part of the
      reason,&rdquo; muttered Farmer Brown's boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little farther on he discovered Little Friend the Song Sparrow very busy
      among the berry-bushes. &ldquo;There's another part of the reason,&rdquo; chuckled
      Farmer Brown's boy. At the end of a long row he sat down to think it over.
      There was no doubt that he owed a great deal to Old Mr. Toad and Little
      Friend and a lot of the feathered folk of the Old Orchard for his
      fine-looking garden, but he had had their help in other years when his
      garden had not looked half as well, and yet when there had not been nearly
      as many bugs and worms as this year. Their help and his own hard work
      accounted for part of the reason for his fine-looking garden, but he
      couldn't help but feel that there must be something else he didn't know
      about.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was thinking so hard that he sat perfectly still. Presently a pair of
      bright eyes peeped out at him from under a berry-bush. Then right out in
      front of him stepped a smart, trim little fellow dressed in brown, gray
      and white with black trimmings. It was Bob White. He called softly and out
      ran Mrs. Bob and fifteen children! At a word from Bob they scattered and
      went to work among the plants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Farmer Brown's boy held his breath as he watched. They didn't pay the
      least attention to him because, you know, he sat perfectly still. Some
      scratched the ground just like the hens at home, and then picked up things
      so small that he couldn't see what they were. But he knew. He knew that
      they were tiny seeds. And because all the seeds which he and Farmer Brown
      had planted were now great strong plants, he knew that these were seeds of
      weeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bob himself was very busy among the potato-vines. He was near enough for
      Farmer Brown's boy to see what he was doing. He was eating those striped
      beetles which Farmer Brown's boy had fought so long and which he had come
      to hate. &ldquo;One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
      eleven,&rdquo; counted Farmer Brown's boy, and then Bob moved on to where he
      couldn't be seen. Among the squash-vines he could see Mrs. Bob, and she
      was picking off bugs as fast as Bob was taking the potato-beetles. What
      the others were doing he didn't know, but he could guess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's the rest of the reason!&rdquo; he suddenly exclaimed in triumph. He
      spoke aloud, and in a twinkling there wasn't a Bob White to be seen.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>armer brown's boy
      used to feel that way, but he doesn't any more. He never could see any use
      in puzzling over sums in school. He said that there wasn't anything
      interesting in it; nothing but hard work. He used to complain about it at
      home. Farmer Brown would listen awhile, then he would say, &ldquo;If you live
      long enough, my son, you will find that figures talk and that they tell
      the most wonderful things.&rdquo; There was always a twinkle in his eyes when he
      said this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now of course Fanner Brown's boy knew that his father didn't mean that
      figures could speak right out. Of course not. But he never could
      understand just what he did mean, and he wasn't interested enough to try
      to find out. So he would continue to scowl over his arithmetic and wish
      the teacher wouldn't give such hard lessons. And when the long summer
      vacation began, he just forgot all about figures and sums until after he
      discovered Bob White and his family helping to rid the garden of bugs and
      worms and seeds of weeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      After he discovered them, he went down to the garden every day to watch
      them. They soon found out that he wouldn't hurt them, and after that they
      just paid no attention to him at all, but went right on with their
      business all about him, and that business was the filling of their
      stomachs with seeds and worms and bugs. One day Bob White ate twelve
      caterpillars while Farmer Brown's boy was watching him. He got out a
      stubby pencil and a scrap of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If every one of those Bob Whites eats twelve of those horrid worms at one
      meal that would be&mdash;let me see.&rdquo; He wrinkled his brows. &ldquo;There are
      Bob and Mrs. Bob and fifteen young Bobs and that makes seventeen. Now if
      each eats twelve, that will make twelve times seventeen.&rdquo; He put down the
      figures on his bit of paper and worked over them for a few minutes. &ldquo;That
      makes 204 caterpillars for one meal,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;and in one month of
      thirty days they would eat 6120 if they only ate one meal a day. But they
      eat ever so many meals a day and that means&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped to stare at
      the figures on the bit of paper with eyes round with wonder. Then he
      whistled a little low whistle of sheer astonishment. &ldquo;No wonder I've got a
      good garden when those fellows are at work in it!&rdquo; he exclaimed.

    <p>
      Then he sat down to watch Mrs. Bob catching cabbage-butterflies which he
      knew were laying the eggs which would hatch out into the worms that
      spoiled the cabbages. He counted the number she caught while she was in
      sight. He did the same thing with another of the Bob Whites who was
      catching cucumber-beetles, and with another who was hunting grasshoppers.
      Then he did some more figuring on that bit of paper. When he had finished
      he got up and went straight down to the cornfield where Farmer Brown was
      at work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know now what you meant when you used to tell me that figures talk,&rdquo;
       said he. &ldquo;Why, they've told me more than I ever dreamed! They've told me
      that the Bob Whites are the best friends we've got, and that the reason
      that we've got the best garden anywhere around is just because they have
      made it so. Why, those little brown birds are actually making money for
      us, and we never guessed it!&rdquo;

      XV. FARMER BROWN'S BOY GROWS INDIGNANT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>O be indignant is
      to be angry in a good cause. If you lose your temper and give way to anger
      because things do not suit you, you are not indignant; you are simply
      angry. But if anger wells up in your heart because of harm or injustice
      which is done to some one else, or even to yourself, then you become
      indignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Farmer Brown's boy had spent all his spare time down in the garden
      watching Bob White and his family. In fact, he had been there so much that
      all the Bob Whites had come to look on him as harmless if not actually a
      friend. They just didn't pay him any attention at all, but went about
      their business as if he were nowhere about. And their business was ridding
      that garden of bugs and worms and seeds of weeds in order to fill their
      stomachs. What tickled Farmer Brown's boy was that the bugs and worms of
      which they seemed the most fond were the very ones which did the most harm
      to the growing plants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over beyond the garden was a field of wheat. You know from wheat comes the
      flour of which your bread is made. Now there is a certain little bug
      called the chinch-bug which is such a hungry rascal that when he and a lot
      of his kind get into a field of wheat, they often spoil the whole crop.
      They suck the juices from the plants so that they wilt and die. Farmer
      Brown's boy had heard his neighbors complaining that chinch-bugs were very
      bad that year, and he knew that they must be by the looks of the wheat on
      the farms of his neighbors. But Farmer Brown's wheat looked as fine as
      wheat could look. It was very plain that there were no chinch-bugs there,
      and he often had wondered why, when they were so bad in the fields of his
      neighbors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Farmer Brown's boy noticed that Bob White and his family spent a great
      deal of time in the wheat-field. One day he noticed Bob picking something
      from a stem of wheat. He went over to see what it might be. Of course Bob
      scurried away, but when Farmer Brown's boy looked at that wheat-plant he
      found some chinch-bugs on it. Then he knew what Bob had been doing. He had
      been picking off and eating those dreadful little bugs. And he knew, too,
      why it was that their wheat-field was the best for miles around. It was
      because Bob White and his family hunted for and ate those bugs as fast as
      they appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurrah for you! You're the greatest little helpers a farmer ever had!&rdquo;
       cried Farmer Brown's boy, and hurried off to tell Farmer Brown what he had
      found out.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the summer passed, and the cool crisp days of autumn came. The wheat
      had been harvested and the vegetables gathered and stored away. Jack Frost
      had begun to paint the maple trees red and yellow, the garden was bare,
      and the stubble in the wheat-field a golden brown. The little feathered
      people who do not like cold weather had flown away to the sunny Southland,
      led by Ol' Mistah Buzzard. Striped Chipmunk, Chatterer the Red Squirrel,
      and Happy Jack the Gray Squirrel were busy from morning till night storing
      away seeds and nuts on which to live through the long cold winter. These
      were glorious days, and Bob White loved every one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Son,&rdquo; said Farmer Brown one morning, &ldquo;those Bob Whites must be fat with
      the good living they have had. Seeing that we have fed them off the farm
      all summer, don't you think that it is their turn to feed us? I think
      broiled Bob White on toast would taste pretty good. The shooting season
      begins next week, so I suppose you will get out your gun and shoot a few
      of those Bob Whites for us.&rdquo; There was a twinkle, a kindly twinkle in his
      eyes as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Farmer Brown's boy didn't see that twinkle. His face grew red. A hot
      anger filled his heart. He was indignant. He was very indignant to think
      that his father should ever hint at such a thing. But he didn't forget to
      be respectful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I wouldn't shoot one of them for anything in the
      world! They don't owe us anything; we owe them. If it hadn't been for
      them, we wouldn't have had half a crop of wheat, and our garden would have
      been just as poor as those of our neighbors. I'm not going to shoot 'em,
      and I'm not going to let any one else shoot 'em if I can help it, so
      there!&rdquo;

      XVI. FARMER BROWN'S BOY TALKS THINGS OVER
    </h2>

      everywhere there would be no terrible wars, no prisons, no dreadful
      poverty, no bitter quarrels between those who work and those for whom they
      work. And on the Green Meadows and in the Green Forest there would be no
      fear of man and no frightful suffering from traps and terrible guns. Love,
      that wonderful great thing which is contained in one little word of four
      letters, could and would bring joy and happiness to every heart for all
      time if only we would give it a chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was love in the heart of Farmer Brown's boy which made him indignant
      when Farmer Brown hinted that he might take his gun and shoot Bob White
      and his family. You see, he had made friends with the Bob Whites and
      learned to love them, and no one can bear the thought of hurting those
      they love. He had replied to his father respectfully, but his face had
      flushed red and in his voice there had been the ring of indignation, which
      is a certain kind of anger. Farmer Brown actually chuckled when he heard
      it. Then he turned and held out his big hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shake hands, son,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I was just trying you out to see what you
      would say. You know you used to be very fond of hunting, and I was just
      wondering if your love of killing, or trying to kill, was stronger than
      your sense of right and justice. Now I know that it isn't, and I'm ever so
      glad. So you think the Bob Whites have earned our protection?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanner Brown's boy's face flushed again, but this time it was with
      pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Dad, I'm so glad you don't want them killed to eat!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I
      ought to have known that you were just teasing me. I did like to hunt with
      my gun once, but that was when I didn't know as much as I do now. It was
      exciting to try to find the birds and then see if I could hit them. I just
      thought of them as wild things good to eat and so smart that I had to be a
      little bit smarter to get them. I never thought of them as having any
      feelings. But now I know that they love, and fear, and suffer pain, and
      work, and play, and are glad and sad, just like people. I know because
      I've watched them. So I don't want to hurt them or allow them to be hurt
      any more than I would real people. Why I <i>love</i> 'em! I wouldn't have
      anything happen to them for the world. I'm dreadfully afraid something
      will happen to some of them when the hunting season begins. Can't we do
      anything for them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can put up some signs warning all hunters to keep off of our farm and
      forbidding all shooting,&rdquo; replied Farmer Brown. &ldquo;Then if Bob White and his
      family are smart enough to stay on our land I guess they will be safe, but
      if they go on the land of other people they are likely to be shot unless&mdash;&rdquo;
       he paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless I can get other people who own land near us to put up signs and
      keep the hunters off and promise not to shoot the Bob Whites themselves!&rdquo;
       exclaimed Farmer Brown's boy eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Farmer Brown smiled. &ldquo;Exactly, my son,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It is your chance to get
      even; to do something for the little friends who have done so much for
      you. Tomorrow is Saturday, and there will be no school. You may have all
      day in which to see what you can do with the neighbors to save Bob White
      and his family from the hunters. Listen! Bob would be a blessing if for
      nothing but his message of good cheer. But to the cheer he puts into the
      world is the daily help he gives. The man who kills Bob White kills one of
      our best friends and helpers, and his shot hurts us more than it does poor
      little Bob. Now let's go over to the barn and see about making those
      signs.&rdquo;

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HERE never was a
      more beautiful day than that crisp October one. It was one of those days
      when you just feel all over how good it is to be alive. Bob White felt it.
      He tingled all over with the joy of living just as soon as he opened his
      eyes very early that morning. He whistled for very joy. He loved all the
      Great World, and he felt that all the Great World loved him. He wanted to
      tell the Great World so. The Merry Little Breezes of Old Mother West Wind,
      tumbling out of the big bag in which she had brought them down from the
      Purple Hills to play all day long on the Green Meadows, danced over to
      tell him that they loved him. This made Bob still happier.
    </p>
    <p>
      A certain man tramping along the road toward the home of Farmer Jones was
      feeling glad, but his gladness was of a different kind. &ldquo;I guess we are
      going to have some sport, old fellow,&rdquo; said he to the dog trotting at his
      heels, and shifted a terrible gun from one shoulder to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now if Bob White had understood the warning given him by Farmer Brown's
      boy he never, never would have done as he did. But he didn't understand
      that warning, and so when he took it into his pretty little head that he
      wanted to try his wings he led his family straight over to the land of
      Farmer Jones. He often had been there before, and he saw no reason why he
      shouldn't go there as often as he pleased. No harm had come from these
      previous visits. So straight over to the stubble of Farmer Jones'
      wheat-field he led the way, and soon he and his family were very busy
      picking up scattered grains of wheat and were happy as you or I would be
      over a good breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Right in the midst of it Bob's quick ears heard footsteps. He stretched
      his neck to peep over the stubble, and suddenly all the gladness and
      brightness of the day was blotted out. What he saw was a dog with his nose
      to the ground and he was following the scent that one of Bob's children
      made as he ran about picking up wheat. Suddenly the dog stopped and stood
      perfectly still, with one foreleg and nose pointing straight at a certain
      spot. Bob knew that right at that spot one of his children was squatting
      close to the ground. As still as a statue stood the dog. From behind him
      came a man walking slowly and carefully and with a terrible gun held in
      readiness. When he reached the dog he sent him on. There was nothing for
      the Bob White squatting there to do but fly. Up into the air he shot on
      swift wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bang!&rdquo; went the terrible gun, and down dropped that little brown bird. At
      the sound of the terrible gun up jumped all the rest of Bob White's
      children in terrible fright, for never before had they heard such a
      dreadful noise. &ldquo;Bang!&rdquo; went the gun again, but this time only a few brown
      feathers floated to the ground. Bob and Mrs. Bob waited until after the
      second bang before they too took to the air, for they had had experience
      and knew that after the second bang they were likely to be safe for a
      while.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bob Whites had scattered in all directions as they had been taught to
      do when in danger. Bob flew straight over to Farmer Brown's wheat-field,
      and there presently he began to call. One after another of his family
      answered, all but the one who had fallen at the first shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got one, anyway,&rdquo; said the hunter, as he loaded his terrible gun, and
      actually looked happy as he went over to help his dog hunt for the Bob
      White who had fallen at the first terrible bang.

      XVIII. THE DISAPPOINTED HUNTER

      shot one of White's children chuckled of course he didn't need it the
      least bit in the world, having plenty of other things to eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hunter who had shot one of the birds gleefully went forward to pick up
      the poor little brown bird. He was having what he called sport. It never
      entered his head to think of how the Bob Whites must feel. He probably
      didn't think that they had any feelings. He was pleased that he had made a
      successful shot, and he was pleased to think that he was to have that
      little brown bird to eat, though when he reached the place where he had
      seen the little Bob White fall, there was no little brown bird there. No,
      Sir, there was not a sign of that little bird save a few feathers. You
      see, he hadn't killed the little Bob White as he had supposed, but had
      broken a wing so that it could not fly. But there was nothing the matter
      with its legs, and no sooner had it hit the ground than it had run as fast
      as ever it could through the stubble. So the little Bob White wasn't where
      the hunter was looking for it at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course his dog helped him hunt, and with that wonderful nose of his he
      soon found the scent of that little Bob White and eagerly followed it. It
      just happened that in that field near where the little Bob White fell was
      an old home of Johnny Chuck, and all around the entrance to it the sand
      had been spread out. Now sand does not hold scent. The little Bob White
      knew nothing about that, for he had not lived long enough to learn all
      that a Bob White has to learn, but he did see the open doorway. Across the
      yellow sand he ran and into the doorway and just a little way down the
      hall, where he hid under some dry, brown leaves which had blown in there.
      He was almost the color of them himself as he squatted close to the ground
      and drew his feathers as close to his body as possible. In doing this he
      was doing a very wise thing, though he didn't know it at the time. You see
      his feathers drawn tightly against his body that way prevented the scent
      which might have told the keen nose of that dog where he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it was, the dog lost the scent at the edge of the sand, and neither he
      nor the hunter once thought to look in that old hole. So while they hunted
      and hunted, the little Bob White squatted perfectly still, though his
      broken wing hurt him dreadfully, and the ache of it made his eyes fill
      with tears. At last the hunter gave up the search. He was too impatient to
      kill more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must be I just wounded him,&rdquo; said he, without one thought of how dreadful
      it must be to be wounded. &ldquo;Probably a fox will get him. Bet I kill the
      next one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that he sent his dog on to try to find the little Bob White's
      brothers and sisters, his terrible gun held ready to shoot the instant he
      should see one of them. He was having great sport, was that hunter, while
      in the hall of Johnny Chuck's old house lay a little brown Bob White faint
      with suffering and dreadful fright. It would have been bad enough to
      simply have such a fright, but to have a broken wing and because of this
      to feel quite helpless&mdash;well, can you imagine anything worse?

    <p>
      He tried to wink them back and to think what he should do next, but he was
      too bewildered to think. To be bewildered is to be so upset that you
      cannot understand what has happened or is happening. It was just so with
      this little Bob White.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his brothers and sisters he had been happily picking up his breakfast
      that beautiful October morning. Without the least warning a great dog had
      threatened to catch him, and he had taken to his swift, strong, little
      wings. As he did so he had seen a great two-legged creature pointing a
      stick at him, but he had not feared. All summer long he had seen
      two-legged creatures like this one, and they had not harmed him. Indeed,
      he had come to look on them as his friends, for had not Farmer Brown's boy
      watched him and his brothers and sisters day after day, and not once
      offered even to frighten them? So he had no fear of this one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then from the end of that stick pointed at him had leaped fire and smoke,
      and there had been a terrible noise. Something had struck him, something
      that stung, and burned and tore his tender flesh, and one of his swift,
      strong, little wings had become useless, so that he fell heavily to the
      ground. Then he had run swiftly until he found this hiding place, and,
      with his little heart going pit-a-pat, pit-a-pat with terror, had squatted
      close under the friendly brown leaves while the great dog and the
      two-legged creature had looked for him. Now they had given him up and gone
      away. At least, he could not hear them.
    </p>
    <p>
      What did it all mean? Why had this dreadful thing happened to him? What
      had he done that the two-legged creature should try to kill him with the
      terrible fire-stick? Outside the day was as beautiful as ever, but all the
      joy of it was gone. Instead, it was filled with terror. What should he do
      now? What <i>could</i> he do? Where were his father and mother and
      brothers and sisters? Were such dreadful things happening to them as had
      happened to him? Would he ever see them again?
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he heard a far-away whistle, a sad, anxious whistle. It was the
      whistle of his father, Bob White. He was calling his family together. Then
      he heard answering whistles, and he knew that the others were safe and
      would soon join Bob White. But he did not dare answer himself. He crawled
      to the doorway and peeped out. He could see the great dog and the cruel
      two-legged creature with the terrible fire-stick far away on the other
      side of the field. He tried to leap into the air and fly as he had been
      used to doing, but only flopped helplessly. One wing was useless and
      dragged on the ground. It hurt so that the pain made him faint.
    </p>
    <p>
      He closed his eyes and lay still for a few minutes, panting. Then a new
      thought filled him with another terrible fear. If Reddy Fox or Old Man
      Coyote or Redtail the Hawk should happen along, how could he escape
      without the use of his wings? If only he were not alone! If only he could
      reach his father and mother perhaps they could help him. He struggled to
      his feet and began to walk towards that distant whistle. It was slow work.
      He was weak and faint, and the drooping wing dragged through the stiff
      stubble and hurt so that it seemed as if he could not stand it. Often he
      squatted down and panted with weariness and pain and fright. Then he would
      go on again. He was terribly thirsty, but there was no water to drink. So
      at last he crawled under a fence, and then suddenly, right in front of
      him, was one of those two-legged creatures! Right then and there the
      little Bob White gave up all hope.

      XX. FARMER BROWN'S BOY SPEAKS HIS MIND
    </h2>
    <p class="indent20">
      You cannot always surely tell
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      If things be ill or things be well.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN the poor
      suffering, wounded little Bob White crawled under the fence he didn't know
      it, but he had crawled on to the land of Farmer Brown, where a sign warned
      all hunters to keep off&mdash;that no shooting would be allowed there. And
      when he looked up and saw right in front of him one of those two-legged
      creatures like the one with the terrible fire-stick, and at once had given
      up all hope, he had been too sick at heart and suffering too much to
      recognize Farmer Brown's boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that is just who it was. You see, Farmer Brown's boy had been so
      anxious for fear that some hunter would come over on his father's land in
      spite of the signs, that he had gone down on the Green Meadows just as
      soon as he had eaten his breakfast. He had seen the hunter on the land of
      Farmer Jones and had heard him shoot. With all his heart Farmer Brown's
      boy had hoped that the hunter had missed. Now as he looked down and saw
      the poor little suffering bird he knew that the hunter had not missed, and
      fierce anger swelled his heart. He quite forgot that he himself used to
      hunt with a terrible gun before he had learned to know and to love the
      little people of the Green Meadows, the Green Forest and the Old Pasture.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stooped and very tenderly lifted the little Bob White, who closed his
      eyes and was sure that now all would soon be over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You poor little thing! You poor, poor little thing!&rdquo; said Farmer Brown's
      boy as he looked at the torn and broken wing. Then he looked across at the
      hunter and scowled savagely. Just then the hunter saw him and at once
      started towards him. You see, the hunter thought that perhaps if he
      offered Farmer Brown's boy money he would allow him to hunt on Farmer
      Brown's land. He knew that was where Bob White and all his family had
      flown to. When he reached the fence, he saw the little Bob White in the
      hands of Farmer Brown's boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; exclaimed the hunter in surprise, &ldquo;I guess that's my bird!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess it's nothing of the sort!&rdquo; retorted Farmer Brown's boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, it is,&rdquo; replied the hunter. &ldquo;I shot it a little while ago, but
      it got away from me. I'll thank you to hand it over to me, young man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll do nothing of the sort,&rdquo; retorted Farmer Brown's boy. &ldquo;It may be
      the bird you shot, more shame to you, but it isn't yours; it's mine. I
      found it on our land, and it belongs to me if it belongs to any one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now the hunter was tempted to reply sharply, but remembering that he
      wanted to get this boy's permission to hunt on Farmer Brown's land, he bit
      the angry reply off short and said instead, &ldquo;Why don't you wring its neck?
      If you'll get your father to let me shoot on your land, I'll kill another
      for you, and then you will have a fine dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Farmer Brown's boy grew red in the face. &ldquo;Don't you dare put your foot on
      this side of the fence!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I'd have you to know that these Bob
      Whites are my very best friends. They've worked for me all summer long,
      and do you suppose I'm going to let any harm come to them now if I can
      help it? Not much! Look how this poor little thing is suffering. And you
      call it sport. Bah! The law lets you hunt them, but it's a bad law. It's a
      horrid law. If they did any harm it would be different. But instead of
      doing harm they work for us all summer long, and then when the crops which
      they have helped us save are harvested, we turn around and allow them to
      be shot! But they can't be shot on this land, and the sooner you get away
      the better I'll like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instead of getting angry the hunter laughed good-naturedly. &ldquo;All right,
      I'll keep off your land, sonny,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But you needn't get so excited.
      They're only birds, and were made to be shot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more than you were!&rdquo; retorted Farmer Brown's boy. &ldquo;And they've got
      feelings just as you have. This poor little thing is trembling like a leaf
      in my hand. I'm not going to wring its neck. I'm going to try to cure it.&rdquo;
       With this Fanner Brown's boy turned his back on the hunter and started for
      home. And the poor little Bob White, not understanding, had no more hope
      than before.

    <h2>
      XXI. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LITTLE BOB WHITE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>ITH his eyes
      tightly closed because of the terror in his heart, the little Bob White
      was being carried by Fanner Brown's boy. Very tender was the way in which
      he was handled, and after a while he began to take a little comfort in the
      warmth of the hand which held him. Once in a while Farmer Brown's boy
      would gently smooth the feathers of the little head and say, &ldquo;Poor little
      chap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Straight home went Farmer Brown's boy. Very, very gently he bathed the
      wounds of the little Bob White. Then, as gently as he could, he put the
      broken bones of the wing back in place and bound them there with little
      strips of thin wood to keep them from slipping. It hurt dreadfully, and
      the little Bob White didn't know what it all meant. But he had suffered so
      much already that a little more suffering didn't matter much, and he
      didn't so much as peep.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was all over he was put into a box with a bed of soft clean hay, a
      little dish of water which he could reach by just stretching out his head,
      and a handful of wheat, and then he was left alone. He was too sick and
      weary to want to do anything but squat down in that bed of hay and rest.
      He was still afraid of what might happen to him, but it was not such a
      great fear as before, for there had been something comforting in the
      gentle touch of Farmer Brown's boy. He didn't understand at all what those
      strange wrappings about his body meant, but a lot of the ache and pain had
      gone from the broken wing.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he drank gratefully of the water, for he had been burning with thirst,
      and then settled himself as comfortably as possible and in no time at all
      was asleep. Yes, Sir, he was asleep! You see, he was so worn out with
      fright and pain that he couldn't keep his eyes open. Ever so many times
      during the day Farmer Brown's boy came to see how he was getting along,
      and was so very gentle and whistled to him so softly that his little heart
      no longer went pita-pat with fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning the little Bob White felt so much better that he was up
      bright and early and made a good breakfast of the wheat left for him. But
      it seemed very queer not to be able to move his wings. He couldn't lift
      them even the teeniest, weeniest bit because, you see, Farmer Brown's boy
      had bound them to his sides with strips of cloth so that he couldn't even
      try to fly. This was so that that broken wing might get well and strong
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now of course the little Bob White had lived out of doors all his life,
      and Farmer Brown's boy knew that he never could be quite happy in the
      house. So he made a wire pen in the henyard, and in one end he made the
      nicest little shelter of pine-boughs under which the little Bob White
      could hide. He put a little dish of clean water in the pen and scattered
      wheat on the ground, and then he put the little Bob White in there.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he was left quite alone the little Bob White ran all about to
      see what his new home was like. You see, there was nothing the matter with
      his legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't get out,&rdquo; thought he, when he had been all around the pen, &ldquo;but
      neither can any one get in, so I am safe and that is something to be
      thankful for. This two-legged creature is not at all like the one with the
      terrible fire-stick, and I am beginning to like him. I haven't got to fear
      Reddy Fox or Old Man Coyote or Redtail the Hawk. I guess that really I am
      a lot better off than if I were out on the Green Meadows unable to fly.
      Perhaps, when my wing gets well, I will be allowed to go. I wonder where
      my father and mother and brothers and sisters are and if any of them were
      hurt by that terrible fire-stick.&rdquo;

      chance Bob White flew up in a tree where he could look down in Fanner
      Brown's henyard, and there he discovered the lost little Bob and talked
      with him. Then Bob White flew back to the Green Meadows where little Mrs.
      Bob was anxiously waiting for him, and his heart was light. Mrs. Bob was
      watching for him and flew to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all right!&rdquo; cried Bob. &ldquo;I found him over in Fanner Brown's henyard.&rdquo;
       Of course &ldquo;him&rdquo; meant the young Bob White who had been given up as killed.
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Bob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is a henyard, and what is he doing there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A henyard is a place where Farmer Brown keeps a lot of big foolish
      birds,&rdquo; explained Bob, &ldquo;and little Bob is a prisoner there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dreadful!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Bob. &ldquo;If he's a prisoner, how can you say it's
      all right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it is,&rdquo; replied Bob. &ldquo;He's perfectly safe there, and he wouldn't
      be if he were here with us. You see, he can't fly. One of his wings was
      broken by the shot from that terrible gun. Farmer Brown's boy found him
      and has been very kind to him. He fixed that wing so that I believe it is
      going to get quite as well as ever. You know quite as well as I do how
      much chance little Bob would have had over here with a broken wing. Reddy
      Fox or Redtail the Hawk or some one else would have been sure to get him
      sooner or later. But up there they can't, because he is in a wire pen. He
      can't get out, but neither can they get in, and so he is safe. He and
      Farmer Brown's boy are great friends. With my own eyes I saw him feed from
      the hand of Farmer Brown's boy. Do you know, I believe that boy is really
      and truly our friend and can be trusted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what Peter Rabbit is always saying, but after all we've suffered
      from them, I can't quite make up my mind that any of those great
      two-legged creatures are to be trusted,&rdquo; said little Mrs. Bob. &ldquo;I've got
      to see for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall,&rdquo; declared Bob. &ldquo;Tomorrow morning you shall go up there and
      I'll stay here to look after the rest of the youngsters. I am afraid if we
      left them alone some of them would be careless or foolish enough to go
      where the hunters with terrible guns would find them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the next morning Mrs. Bob went up to visit young Bob, and she saw all
      that Bob had seen the day before. She returned with a great load off her
      mind. She knew that Bob was right, and that Fanner Brown's boy had proved
      himself a true friend from whom there was nothing to fear. The next day
      Bob and Mrs. Bob took the whole family up there, for Fanner Brown's boy
      had scattered food for them just outside the henyard where the biddies
      could not get it, and Bob was smart enough to know that no hunter would
      dare look for them so close to Farmer Brown's house. Morning after morning
      they went up there to get their breakfast, and they didn't even fly when
      Farmer Brown's boy and Farmer Brown himself came out to watch them eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then one morning a wonderful thing happened. Farmer Brown's boy took young
      Bob out of his pen in the hen-yard. Young Bob looked quite himself by this
      time, for the strips of cloth which had bound his broken wing in place had
      been taken off, and his wing was as good as ever. Fanner Brown's boy took
      him outside the henyard and gently put him down on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you are! Now go and join your family and in the future keep out of
      the way of hunters,&rdquo; said he, and laughed to see young Bob scamper over to
      join his brothers and sisters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a fuss as they made over him! Suddenly Bob White flew up to the top
      of a post, threw back his head and whistled with all his might, &ldquo;Bob
      White! Bob White! Bob White!&rdquo; You see, he just had to tell all the Great
      World of the joy in his heart, although this was not the time of year in
      which he usually whistles.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this is how it happened that Bob White and his whole family came
      regularly to Farmer Brown's for their breakfasts, and no hunter ever had
      another chance to carry fright and suffering and sorrow into their midst.
    </p>
    <p>
      So this is all about Bob White and his family because Ol' Mistah Buzzard
      has come all the way up from Ol' Virginny for me to tell you about him and
      his adventures. I've promised to do it in the very next book.
